We are given a series of emojis, curly brackets and underscores. Those are aranged in a way such that it's pretty easy to recognize a flag disguised as a sequence of emojis. It's also intuitive to recognize that every letter of the flag is encoded with an emoji that rapresents an animal/object which has as first letter of its name as the above-mentioned letter.  
In order to decrypt the flag, the only thing we have to do is to replace every emoji with the first letter of its name (for clarity's sake I've substituted every emoji with it's name and capitalized and bolded the first letter):

**U**mbrella**T**urkey**F**ire**L**ion**A**pple**G**uitar{**E**lephant**M**ango**O**nio**J**uggler**I**ce**S**un_**B**omb**E**lephant_**V**olcano**E**lephant**R**ainbow**S**un**A**pple**T**urkey**I**ce**L**ion**E**lephant}
