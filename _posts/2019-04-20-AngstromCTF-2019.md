        (setq out (append out (list (/ (nth ind uwuth) -1))))))
    
(defun multh (plain)
    (cond
        ((null plain) nil)
        (t (cons (whats-this (- 1 (car plain)) (car plain)) (multh (cdr plain))))))

(defun owo (inpth)
    (setf out nil)
    (do ((redth *reorder* (cdr redth)))
        ((null redth) out)
        (setq out (append out (list (nth (car redth) inpth))))))

(defun whats-this (x y)
    (cond
        ((equal y 0) 0)
        (t (+ (whats-this x (- y 1)) x))))

;flag was encrypted with (enc *flag*) to give *encrypted*
```

The code with which we are welcomed, after some research, turned up to be Lisp.

After rolling up our sleeves and getting a grip of Lisp basics,
an analysis of the program shows the following: 

* **enc(plain)**

    Is the initial function at which is passed the plaintext flag.<br>
    It then passes the flag to **multh()** and what's returned is further processed throught **owo()**. Berfore returning the resulting list, the sign of every number is inverted;

* **whats-this(x y)**

    This one is just an obfuscation of a simple multiplication between x and y;

* **multh(plain)**

    Every number "x" form **plain** list is multiplied by "1-x" (with **whats-this()**) and the added to a list that's at the end returned; 

* **owo(inpth)**

    Scramble **inpth** following indexes of **\*reoder\*** global list 

Knowing how the program works, is just a matter of writing a script that does all this backwards.

The challenge provides a 64bit ELF Executable. To undestand what it does, decompiling it with [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) is going to be helpful.

These are the importants bits from main (after formatting):
```c
undefined8 main(void) {
  size_t input_len;
  bool valid;
  char input[24];
  
  puts("Enter your input:");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00400b96,input);
  input_len = strlen(input);
  if (input_len < 0x13) {
    puts("Flag is too short.");
  }
  else {
    valid = check(input);
    if ((int)valid == 0) {
      puts("That\'s not the flag.");
    }
    else {
      puts("You found the flag!");
    }
  }
}
```

After the input validation part, the only interesting function is **"check(input)"**.

```c
bool check(char *input) {
int iVar1;

  iVar1 = d(input + 0xc);
  if ((((((iVar1 != 0) && (iVar1 = v((ulong)(uint)(int)*input), iVar1 != 0)) &&
        (iVar1 = u((ulong)(uint)(int)input[0x10],(ulong)(uint)(int)input[0x11],
                   (ulong)(uint)(int)input[0x11]), iVar1 != 0)) &&
       ((iVar1 = k((ulong)(uint)(int)input[5]), iVar1 == 0 &&
        (iVar1 = k((ulong)(uint)(int)input[9]), iVar1 == 0)))) &&
      ((iVar1 = w(input + 1), iVar1 != 0 &&
       ((iVar1 = b(input,0x12), iVar1 != 0 && (iVar1 = b(input,4), iVar1 != 0)))))) &&
     ((iVar1 = z(input,0x6c), iVar1 != 0 && (iVar1 = s(input), iVar1 != 0)))) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

At first it might be a little bewildering but looking at the flow of things, it's just a bunch of checks that in the end returns either true or false.

Challenges like this might easily be solved with [Symbolic Execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution) if they don't scale too much resulting in a [Path Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution#Path_explosion).

One awesome tool that does Symbolic Execution and much more is [**"angr"**](http://angr.io).

Here's the python script used to solve this challenge with angr.

```python
import angr

p = angr.Project('./high_quality_checks', auto_load_libs=False)
state = p.factory.entry_state()
sm = p.factory.simulation_manager(state)
destinationAddr = HEX_ADDRESS # Where is executed "puts("You found the flag!");"
sm.explore(find=destinationAddr)

if len(sm.found) > 0:
    for targetstate in sm.found:
        print(targetstate.posix.dumps(0))
```

## Classy Cipher (20 pts)

> Every CTF starts off with a Caesar cipher, but we're more classy.<br><br>
> Author: defund

```python
from secret import flag, shift

def encrypt(d, s):
    e = ''
    for c in d:
        e += chr((ord(c)+s) % 0xff)
    return e

assert encrypt(flag, shift) == ':<M?TLH8<A:KFBG@V'
```

This is nothing more than a regular implementation of a caesar cipher.
Knowing the flags format ( **"actf{...}"** ), displacement can be easily acquired subtracting any known character with its encrypted one.

```python
def decrypt(d, s):
    e = ''
    for c in d:
        e += chr((ord(c)-s) % 0xff)
    return e

enc = ':<M?TLH8<A:KFBG@V'
flag = decrypt(enc, ord(':')-ord('a'))
```

```

As the variables names suggest, this is RSA.

For deciphering the message is needed the private key that's not so easily given.
But it can be generated since everything required is provided.

For working with RSA, there's an awesome tool: [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool)

```bash
./RsaCtfTool.py -p $P -q $Q -e $E --uncipher $C
```

Remove the "\x00" padding, et voil√†!

## Half and Half (50 pts)

> Mm, coffee. Best served with half and half!<br><br>
> Author: defund

```python
from secret import flag

def xor(x, y):
	o = ''
	for i in range(len(x)):
		o += chr(ord(x[i])^ord(y[i]))
	return o

assert len(flag) % 2 == 0

half = len(flag)//2
milk = flag[:half]
cream = flag[half:]

assert xor(milk, cream) == '\x15\x02\x07\x12\x1e\x100\x01\t\n\x01"'
```

This challenge code, halves the flag and xor together the two parts. The goal is to recover the initial flag from the given result of the xor.

The length of the flag is just twice the length of the resulting xor. That is 24 (look out for those not hex encoded chars).

Being xor a function that, if applied twice with the same value cancels itself: _`A ‚®Å B ‚®Å B = A`_, to start off, flag format characters ( **"actf{}"** ) can be used to retrieve a few others.

```
a c t f { ? ? ? ? ? ? _
t a s t e ? ? ? ? ? ? }

a c t f { ? ? ? ? ? ? _ t a s t e ? ? ? ? ? ? }
```

As the challenge description suggests, the word **coffee** can be tried seeing that it fits in and would also make sense with the following word **taste**.

That was indeed the right word, so the entire flag is revealed.

```no-highlight
a c t f { c o f f e e _
t a s t e s _ g o o d }
