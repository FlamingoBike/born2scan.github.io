The following challenges were based on Ethereum smart contracts.

## Multi-Owner Contract

> My friend wanted to create a new type of ownable contract where multiple people can be owners. However, when he deployed it for his token sale, someone managed to add themself and many other owners and they minted tons of their own tokens! Luckily the sale hasn't started yet, help him find the bug so he can deploy a new contract and save his ICO.

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Ownable {

    event OwnerAdded(address);
    event OwnerRemoved(address);

    address public implementation;
    mapping (address => bool) public owners;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(owners[msg.sender], "Must be an owner to call this function");
        _;
    }

    /** Only called when contract is instantiated
     */
    function contructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
        owners[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    /** Add an owner to the owners list
     *  Only allow owners to add other owners
     */
    function addOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        owners[_owner] = true;
        emit OwnerAdded(_owner);
    }

    /** Remove another owner
     *  Only allow owners to remove other owners
     */
    function removeOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        owners[_owner] = false;
        emit OwnerRemoved(_owner);
    }

    /** Remove all owners mapping and relinquish control of contract
     */
    function renounceOwnership() public {
        assembly {
            sstore(owners_offset, 0x0)
        }
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to clean up contract and return funds
     */
    function killContract() public onlyOwner {
        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to check if challenge is complete
     */
    function isComplete() public view returns(bool) {
        return owners[msg.sender];
    }

}
```

This first ETH challenge was quite easy even for somebody who never worked with Smart Contracts before, it just needed some fine grained research (and setting up the development environment, which wasn't so straightforward as well for a novice).

The vulnerability lied in a [malformed constructor](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/docs/SWC-118):

```
/* Only called when contract is instantiated */
function contructor() public payable {
    require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
    owners[msg.sender] = true;
}
```

Having been prepended with the `function` keyword, this was no more a constructor but instead a publicly callable function; as such, it could be exploited to gain __Owner__ status by just sending 0.5 ETH its way.

## Hash Slinging Slasher

> Try to guess the random number I chose. I've hashed the value before storing it in the contract so you can't cheat! You'll never figure this one out :)

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashSlingingSlasher {

    bytes32 answer = 0xed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1;

    constructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
    }

    /** Guess the hashed number. Refunds ether if guessed correctly
     */
    function guess(uint16 number) public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.25 ether, "Must send 0.25 Ether");
        if(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(number)) == answer) {
            msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }

    /** Returns balance of this contract
     */
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to check if challenge is complete
     */
    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance == 0;
    }

}
```

The `guess` function takes a number, encodes it via `abi.encodePacked` and then hashes it via `keccak256` (Ethereum's hashing algorithm, a SHA-3 variant that predates its final and official release).

Since `guess` takes its input as an _uint16_, the keyspace for a bruteforce attack would be composed of single integers in the range _{0..65535}_. No fuss with any modern processor! The encoding function can be replicated as well: [it is equivalent byte-casting](https://medium.com/@libertylocked/what-are-abi-encoding-functions-in-solidity-0-4-24-c1a90b5ddce8#3f98).

Due to this additional encoding needed before hashing, using cracking tools like Hashcat became too cumbersome and instead we rolled our own bruteforcer:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sha3  # pip install pysha3
import struct
import sys


def hash(packed):
    """
    Compute the Keccak256 has of a string/byte/packed object.
    """
    k = sha3.keccak_256()
    k.update(packed)
    return k.hexdigest()


def iterate(endianness, min_n, max_n, target):
    """
    Iterate from min_n to max_n, pack the number with the given endianness,
    hash it and compare it with the target.
    """
    for i in range (min_n, max_n+1):
        print("*** Trying {} ({} endian)...".format(i, endianness), end='\r')
        packing_fmt = '<H' if endianness == 'little' else '>H'
        packed = struct.pack(packing_fmt, i)
        hexdigest = hash(packed)
        if hexdigest == target:
            print("\n>>> FOUND! {} <<<".format(i))
            print("\tTarget: {}".format(target))
            print("\tHashed: {}".format(hexdigest))
            print("\tPacked: {}\n".format(packed))
            return
    print("*** No matching hash found.")


def main():
    if (len(sys.argv) < 4):
        print("Usage: ./crack_keccak.py {TARGET_HASH} {MIN_N} {MAX_N}\n")
        quit(1)

    target = sys.argv[1]
    min_n = int(sys.argv[2])
    max_n = int(sys.argv[3])
    print("*** Targeting hash: {} with keyspace {}-{}\n".format(target, min_n, max_n))

    iterate('little', min_n, max_n, target)
    iterate('big', min_n, max_n, target)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

```no-highlight
$ ./crack_keccak.py ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1 0 65535
*** Targeting hash: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1 with keyspace 0-65535

*** Trying 6452 (little endian)...
>>> FOUND! 6452 <<<
	Target: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Hashed: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Packed: b'4\x19'

*** Trying 13337 (big endian)...
>>> FOUND! 13337 <<<
	Target: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Hashed: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Packed: b'4\x19'
```

At first endianness wasn't accounted for in this solution and numbers were only packed as little endian, but since `6452` didn't get us the flag the second endianness check was implemented and indeed the right number to feed to `guess` turned out to be `13337`.

> However, The Kernel discovered that The Link Saver had a little bit of an SSRF problem that allowed any user to fetch the code for The Link Saver‚Ñ¢ from https://localhost/key and host it themselves :grimacing:. Fortunately, with a lil' parse_url magic, SIT Industries¬Æ PHP wizards have patched this finding from Kernel Sanders¬Æ and are keeping the code behind this wonderful site secure!<br>

The given URL replied with a pretty standard form, the source wasn't giving out any interesting hints:

Feeding in URLs worked as axpected:

Since the backstory of the challenge pointed to PHP's `parse_url` function, it was enough to find [an interesting known vulnerability](https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2017070054) that enabled users to feed malformed data to it: the string `https://born2scan.github.io:80#@localhost/key` would be splitted on the hash and the second part would be evaluated without checks.
